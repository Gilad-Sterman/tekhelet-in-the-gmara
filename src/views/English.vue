            <h2>The background for the period</h2>
            <p>Tekhelet accompanied the people of Israel from the beginning of our time as a nation. The Tekhelet,
                which was considered a precious royal color, is mentioned in the description of the work of the Mishkan,
                the
                priestly clothes and the Mitzvah of Tzitzit. The Torah commands: "Speak to the children of Israel and
                say to
                them they should make Tzitzit on the corners of their clothes for their generations and put a Tekhelet
                string on the
                Tzitzit of the corner" (BaMidbar 15:36), and from that moment, Jews used Tekhelet and cast it in their
                tassels.

                        When he saw a matron wearing a purple dress, he got so angry that he orderded his guards to

                        In the year 70 the crown fell off our head and our temple was destroyed by the Romans.

                        The temple - with its veils, wall coverings and tools, and the clothes of the priests who served
                        in the service of God - was the biggest 'customer' of the Tekhelet market.

                        Due to the destruction, the Tekhelet industry entered a deep crisis that affected the snail
                        hunters, the dyers and the entire supply chain.

                        Despite the crisis, Jews continued to adhere to the Mitzvah of putting the Tekhelet string in
                        their tassels.

                        The Roman general Lucius Quietus was sent to suppress the rebellion and did so with a harsh and

                        During the harsh years of fighting the Romans, the lives of the Jews of the Land of Israel were
                        difficult, oppressed and impoverished.

                        And when faced with a new spiritual reality of Judaism without a temple, the Jews found
                        themselves in new situations that required bold halachic responses.

                        For the first time we hear the words of R. Yossi Galili, who presents the tradition he received
                        from his teacher, R. Yochanan ben Nuri, according to which when it is not possible to obtain
                        Tekhelet, one must continue to wear a tassel with only white threads.

                        The objects they left behind were discovered by archaeologists and tell their story, 2,000 years
                        later.

                        This small piece of cloth, dyed sky blue, a color that came from a Murex Trunculus snail, proves

                        During this period it was very dangerous to collect snails and produce Tekhelet.

                        R. Yossi says that he met a fisherman who warned him that the snails are surrounded by poisonous
                        monstrous creatures...

                        Rabbi's time marked the peak of Jewish life in the Land of Israel after the destruction.

                        Rabbi himself was the ideal leader: "Torah and greatness in one place".

                        During his lifetime the Romans did not impose restrictions on the production of Tekhelet and the
                        price was not exorbitant.

                        Rabbi felt that there was no excuse not to observe the Mitzvah of Tzitzit in the perfect way,
                        with both white and Tekhelet threads.

                        He ruled that without Tekhelet you should not wear Tzitzit at all.

                        The city of Tyre was known as the center of the Murex dye industry since the days of King
                        Solomon.

                        King Hiram of Tyre sent craftsmen to help build the temple, among them were also experts in
                        Tekhelet.

                        During the period of the Mishna and the Talmud, Tyre was a trading center, and its most
                        important commodity was snail-dyed fabrics.

                        This can be seen on the coin depicting the founding myth of Tyre - Hercules' dog discovering the
                        Murex.

                        Trade knows no borders, and businessmen often traveled from Israel to Tyre, and learned
                        firsthand about the dye industry there.

                        The Midrash even tells about Rabbi Haya and Rabbi Shimon (Rabbi's son) who went to Tyre to trade
                        textiles.

                        Abaye, who lived in Babylon far from the Tekhelet snails in the Mediterranean Sea, questioned
                        Rabbi Shmuel bar Yehuda upon his arrival from Israel:

                        "Tekhelet, how do you dye it?"

                        The answer was somewhat laconic - you take snail extract, add chemicals, heat it... that in
                        relation to dyeing.

                        But there were additional halachic considerations, Rabbi Shmuel said,

                        In other words, one must be very careful not to spoil the dye vat by doing actions that are not
                        directly related to the dyeing Mitzvah.

                        From this we learn the importance of the proper intention at each stage of dyeing - for the sake
                        of the Mitzvah of Tzitzit.

                        The Gmara tells of two Jews from Israel who brought Tekhelet to Raba, a great Amorite in
                        Babylon,

                        But they were caught on their way by an "eagle".

                        The story had a happy ending, "thanks to mercy and thanks to them they got out safely".

                        Despite the decrees of the Romans (whose symbol was an eagle) that prohibited the use of
                        Tekhelet and Argaman,

                        Jews still risked their lives to fulfill the Mitzvah of Tzitzit in its entirety with the
                        Tekhelet string.

                        They were also willing to smuggle Tekhelet from Israel to their brothers in Babylon despite the
                        dangers involved.

                        The Talmud tells about the tests carried out by Rav Achai to determine if blue threads are
                        authentic Tekhelet or Kala Ilan - a fake dye of plant origin.

                        This Gmara teaches us some important things:

                        â€¢ The appearance of Kala Ilan (indigo) is exactly the same as that of Tekhelet.

                        â€¢ There are only two options to paint in the Tekhelet color - with Tekhelet from the snail or
                        with Kala Ilan, and there is no third option.

                        â€¢ And most importantly, the Tekhelet was available until the days of Rav Achai, but this is the
                        last documentation of its use.

                        This is what Rabbi Yitzhak Halevi Herzog writes in his monumental work on the subject of
                        Tekhelet.

                        Despite the difficulty of obtaining Tekhelet, despite the exorbitant price, and in the face of

                        The seventh century saw the destruction of the Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel.

                        The Byzantines, who ruled there for centuries, were pushed out by the Persians.

                        A few years later, the country was again conquered by the Byzantines, a conquest that resulted
                        in the death of tens of thousands of Jews.

                        Shortly thereafter, the Arab armies led by Caliph Umar defeated the Byzantines and the Persians,
                        and took control of all the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.

                        When the dyeing houses were destroyed, the secrets of the dyeing craft and the knowledge of the
                        identity of the snail were also lost, and the production processes were covered in the mists of
